I am the founding member and bass-payer of the Rome-based parody metal band 
<a href="http://www.nanowar.it" target="_blank">Nanowar Of Steel</a>, which is active since 2003 with more than a
hundred of shows in Italy and Europe, four self-released albums and a live DVD.
You can check us out on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/nanowarVEVO" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
and on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nanowarofsteel" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.

I also like foreign languages, besides Italian and English I am fluent in Spanish and Serbian; I also have a good command of German, French and Russian.
At the moment, I am trying to learn Hebrew and Arabic (Shami and MSA).
<br><br>
In the spare time, I try to read as much as possible about economics and finance as well as history (breakup of Yugoslavia and SSSR in particular).
