I am the founder and bass-payer of the Rome-based parody metal band 
<a href="http://www.nanowar.it" target="_blank">Nanowar Of Steel</a>, which is active since 2003 with
hundres of shows in Italy and Europe, five albums, a live DVD and millions of YouTube views.
You can check us out on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/nanowarVEVO" target="_blank">YouTube</a>
and on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/nanowarofsteel" target="_blank">Facebook</a>.
<br><br>
I also like foreign languages, besides Italian and English I am fluent in Spanish and Serbo-Croatian; 
I also have a good command of German, French, Russian, modern Hebrew and Arabic (both Levantine dialect and MSA).
I can have meaningful conversations in Portuguese and at the moment I am learning Mandarin Chinese.
<br><br>
In what's left of my spare time, I enjoy reading as much as possible about economics and finance (monetary policy, banking and business cycle) 
as well as history (breakup of Yugoslavia, former Soviet Union and modern Middle East in particular).
<br><br>
My philosophical and religious views are summarized in this paper: <a href="http://vixra.org/abs/1704.0001" target="_blank">Foundations of Gauge Theology</a>.
